# Dark Maze
A fun little game that combines my [2D Ray Casting](https://https://vspecky.github.io/BrowserCanvasProjects/RayCasting/index.html) and [Maze Generation](https://https://vspecky.github.io/BrowserCanvasProjects/MazeGenerator/index.html) projects. You're a point who can only see stuff in a conical FOV. Navigate your way through the maze from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Simple but fun.

## Instructions
- Press and hold the W key to move forward.
- Press and hold the `S` key to move backwards.
- Press and Hold the `A` and `D` keys to rotate the point.
- Click the `Restart` button to reset the point and generate a new maze.
- Click the `Show Walls` button to show the maze walls.
