# Chaos Game
The Sierpinski Triangle version of the Chaos Game. This is especially mind blowing to me.

## The Algorithm
- 3 random points are chosen at the start such that they form a triangle.
- A 'Wanderer' is placed at the centroid of the triangle.
- At every step, the wanderer chooses one of the three points, moves halfway to the point and marks the new point white.
- This gives rise to the famous Sierpinski Triangle.
- Press `Reset` to reset the simulation.
